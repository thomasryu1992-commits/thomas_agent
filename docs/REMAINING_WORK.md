# Remaining Work — canonical to-do list

**This is the single place to answer "what's left to build?" from any machine.**
It is committed to git on purpose: per-machine memory does not travel between computers,
so the durable hand-off lives here. On a fresh machine: `git pull`, then read this file.

Last updated: **2026-07-26**, after the review round, the CLAUDE.md split, and the structural-review
queue draining (`main` = `6ed1b0a`).
Every claim below was re-checked against `main` and against the code it describes, not carried over.

> **The one thing to read first:** an order path **exists**, and since 2026-07-26 so does the
> **executing leg** that opens, protects and closes a live position. `financial_transaction_execution_implemented`
> is `true`. Live trading still cannot start, and the reasons are now entirely structural rather than
> "the code is missing": **no autonomous entry point may import the order path** (a test enforces it,
> and the readiness board reports it as a computed row), `financial_executor_enabled` is `false`,
> **0 of 3** clean canary orders have been placed, and every egress needs the operator's per-machine
> `live_trading` grant, order key, confirmation phrase and registered budget.
>
> The single remaining build item between this repository and an **autonomous** live order is
> **cycle routing** — giving the executing leg a caller. It is deliberately unbuilt, and building it
> is the decision to relax the tripwire test.

Keep it current — when a milestone ships, tick its box or delete it here in the same PR.

Authoritative detail for each item lives in the linked roadmap docs; this file is the index.

Its counterpart is [`BUILD_HISTORY.md`](BUILD_HISTORY.md) — what has already been **delivered**, and
why each piece is shaped the way it is. The two together are the whole picture; `CLAUDE.md` states
the rules and deliberately claims no status, so that status has as few owners as possible.

## In-flight PRs

**None** (verified 2026-07-26 07:05 UTC). The parallel structural review's two PRs both landed:

- **#201 — the canary confirmation phrase never reached the guard.** `resolve_live_order_limits`
  dropped `canary_confirmation` on both branches, so **every** canary refused. It failed *closed*,
  so nothing unsafe happened — but it broke the one live door that has to work before any autonomous
  path can, and it was only discoverable by an operator standing at a terminal with real keys. Worth
  remembering for the reason it hid: both sides of the seam were tested, the **join** was not.
- **#203 — structural review follow-ups**: one cap source (both guards now *require* `limits`, the
  LP5.1c treatment applied again), one number reader (`coerce.as_float` — the duplicated *rule*
  mattered more than the duplicated code), design records that state where they stand plus a gate
  keeping them honest, an end-to-end **seam test** for one live trade, and a test-session guard that
  no longer blames a test for the live runtime's own writes.

Everything below otherwise reflects merged `main` at `dd900ea`. The LP4/LP5 wave landed 2026-07-25/26:
#184 (LP4 increment 2b + the governance flip), #183 (LP5.1), #186 (LP5.2), #187 (LP5.4), #193 (LP5.3's
decision half), **#196 (LP5.3's executing leg)**, then the review round — **#200** (the P5 audit gap,
the verdict fail-open, readiness drift, `r_basis`) and **#205** (the CLAUDE.md split) — plus #191/#192
(risk-guard provenance scoping), #199/#202 (dashboard), #204 (operator channel), and #188/#194 (this
file's previous refreshes).

One PR was **closed unmerged**: **#175** — a second LP4 order adapter written in a worktree without
re-checking `main`, which by then already carried `live_execution.py` (increment 1) with its reviewed
design record. Two adapters must not coexist: "which code can send an order" is exactly the question
this repo keeps unambiguous, so the one with the design record stayed. Its still-useful pieces are
catalogued in the PR body; the branch is `worktree-crypto-lp4-adapter`.

## A. Prediction-market trading (Kalshi / Polymarket) — not started

Roadmap: [`docs/PREDICTION_MARKET_ROADMAP_V0.1.md`](PREDICTION_MARKET_ROADMAP_V0.1.md) (on `main`).
**No code exists for this track yet** — every box below is open.
Phasing: observe (no money) → paper (no external effect) → approval-gated live (per-order approval).

- [ ] **PM0 — venue access** (operator-only, no code): Kalshi international signup (KYC), Polymarket
      Polygon/USDC wallet, and the **Korean regulatory judgment call** (grey area). Blocks PM3 only,
      not PM1/PM2.
- [~] **PM1 — observe-only pipeline** (2–3 PRs; no money, no account needed): **started
      2026-07-26** — the venue adapters have landed; matching and the detector are open.
  - [x] Read-only venue adapters (Kalshi REST; Polymarket Gamma + CLOB) behind
        `kalshi_market_data` / `polymarket_market_data` safety flags, DEGRADED semantics —
        done 2026-07-26 (`runtime/mvp_runtime/predmarket/market_data.py`). One normalized
        shape (YES-side probability in `(0,1)`, sizes in contracts) so no venue's vocabulary
        reaches the comparison. Field names verified against both API references on the day,
        which is how we learned **Kalshi now serves decimal-dollar strings**
        (`yes_bid_dollars`), not the integer cents an older API used — a parser written from
        memory would have read nothing. Polymarket is quoted from the **CLOB book only**;
        Gamma's `outcomePrices` are a derived figure, and a market whose book was not read
        comes back *unquoted* rather than priced. **No bid is not a bid of zero**: every
        price is `float | None`, and 0 / ≥1 / unparseable all read as "not quoted".
  - [x] Event-pair matching — auto candidate generation + **operator confirmation per pair**
        — done 2026-07-26 (`predmarket/matching.py`, `pairs.py`, `pairs_cli.py`).
        Deterministic only: normalized token overlap + close-date proximity, with **numeric
        tokens as their own gate** (token overlap alone scores "BTC above 100k" against
        "Bitcoin above 90k" at 0.71 — boilerplate outvotes the one token that IS the
        question). Unknown is never mismatch: a Kalshi market has no category, so a missing
        one is excluded from the decision rather than counted against it. Confirmation
        **requires a note comparing how both venues resolve the event** — the risk no text
        comparison can see — and one market belongs to at most one pair. Every judgement,
        including near-misses, records which gate failed and by how much: that record is what
        makes decision #2's LLM-gap loop able to *fix* the rules rather than just widen them.
  - [ ] LLM-assisted widening pass on a schedule + gap lineage (decision #2's second half;
        needs the deterministic matcher above, or "missed" has no meaning).
  - [ ] Fee-adjusted opportunity detector (Kalshi fee ≈ $0.07·P·(1−P)/contract; Polymarket gas+spread).
  - [ ] Observation records + `pm_scan` R6 scheduler template ⚠️ (cadence + per-scan market cap).
  - [ ] **Exit artifact:** 2–4 week report — frequency × net margin × **persistence duration** per
        strategy. Persistence decides whether PM3 (minutes of approval latency) can ever catch it.
- [ ] **PM2 — paper trading** (1–2 PRs): pessimistic fill model (taker + book depth + fees), virtual
      portfolio, **hold-to-resolution** (also measures cross-venue resolution mismatch).
  - [ ] ⚠️ Thomas sets **PM3 entry criteria as numbers** before PM2 ends.
- [ ] **PM3 — approval-gated live orders** ⚠️⚠️ — **triple-blocked**: PM0 done + PM2 criteria met +
      the live-execution governance packet (section C) implemented. Per-order R9 approval +
      single-use consumption behind `kalshi_trade` / `polymarket_trade` grants. Third consumption
      scope decision required.
- [ ] Resolve the **7 open decisions** in the roadmap's decision register (pm_scan template,
      LLM-assisted matching on/off, PM3 numeric criteria, trading-budget record shape, third
      consumption scope, Korean legal call, PM4 bounded autonomy).

**Out of scope (each its own future decision):** PM4 bounded autonomy, market making, directional/news
trading, leverage, any US-context Polymarket access.

## B. LLM orchestration (M-series) — request → tiered model → verify → deliver

Roadmap: `docs/LLM_ORCHESTRATION_ROADMAP_V0.1.md` (on `main`).
**This track is code-complete.** The only open line is M5b, which is an operator action, not a build.

- [x] **M0** env cleanup (done 2026-07-24).
- [x] **M1** difficulty triage 상/중/하, observe-only — merged (PR #145).
- [x] **M2** difficulty → OpenRouter tier model — merged (PR #149). Per-tier grants + model slugs
      stay the local operator step; until minted, every run degrades cleanly to the base chain.
- [x] **M3** verify-fail → bounded LLM revision loop (opt-in `--revise`, hard cap 1) — merged (PR #150).
- [x] **M4a** crypto: second-pass win-rate + risk-reward ranking — merged (PR #148).
- [x] **M4b** crypto: the strategy proposer on a schedule (`crypto_propose` kind) — done. Per-run
      cap (existing) + unreviewed-backlog cap (distinct accepted-but-uninstalled families; skip +
      audit `skipped_backlog_full:N` past 12, 30-day window). Installing a family clears its
      backlog slot. Also registered the proposal ledger kind (a latent persist bug).
- [x] **M5a** correction → working-memory CANDIDATE — done. A successful M3 revision (REVISE→PASS)
      or a `/feedback bad <note>` mints a correction candidate (ALLOW-tier, audited on the
      memory-event stream, CANDIDATE-only). `runtime/mvp_runtime/memory.py`
      (`build_correction_candidate`/`build_learning_event`), wired in `pipeline.py` +
      `operator_feedback.py`.
- [ ] **M5b** Thomas promotes useful correction candidates to VALIDATED — **standing operator habit,
      not a build item.** The door already exists (`/memory` to list, `/promote` to approve, or
      `scripts/promote_memory_candidate.py`); nothing here is waiting on code. It stays open on
      purpose: M5a captures corrections as unverified `[M#]` candidates and M5c only feeds back what
      was promoted, so the loop produces nothing until someone says yes. That gate is the feature —
      it is what keeps a bad correction from entrenching itself as standing guidance.
- [x] **M5c** a promoted VALIDATED correction feeds back as a correction to *apply* (`[V#]`,
      distinctly framed) — done. `promote_candidate` carries the correction marker forward;
      `worker._validated_context` frames it. Known limit: only revision-path corrections are
      promotable (they carry origin); feedback-path corrections stay `[M#]` until origin can be
      reconstructed from the delivered run.
- [x] **M5d** repeated identical corrections surface at the programization review as a read-only
      correction lineage — done 2026-07-25 (option C, reuse-first: `correction_lineage_for_pattern`
      + `programization_cli lineage <pattern_id>`; no new schema/counter). Codifying stays the
      existing operator-gated programization flow.

---

## C. Crypto live execution — the governance packet + the order code

Decision record: `docs/runtime-contracts/LIVE_EXECUTION_GOVERNANCE_V0.1.md` (decided 2026-07-23;
**the governance packet is fully implemented** — the last item, the LP4-coupled flag, flipped with
#184 on 2026-07-25; that doc's own step table remains the authority). Status:
`docs/runtime-contracts/CRYPTO_LIVE_EXECUTION_V0.1.md`.

**What is left in this section is no longer governance, and no longer plumbing — it is one build
decision and one operator action:** cycle routing (below), and three clean canary orders. Neither is
blocked on a contract, a schema, or a gate.

The money path now carries its own governance record (**#200**): a P5 PermissionDecision built before
the order and an audit event after it, closing `p5_policy_gate`'s `post_action_report_and_audit`,
which was the one requirement in that gate with no implementation. Binding also means **no live order
without an active approved Core**.

The `feat/cost-budget-ledger` dependency this section once recorded is **void** — that branch was
never pushed and the sequencing was deliberately reversed (2026-07-24); the two claim different
scopes at different levels, so nothing was owed to it.

- [x] **Governance implementation** — steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9 done (PR #142): `permission_decision.v0.4`
      adds `FINANCIAL_APPROVED_TRADING_USE`; the scope is in `policy_dispositions.EXECUTE_AND_REPORT`;
      `p5_policy_gate` is defined; `permission.py` builds a live-order decision at P5; the v0.4
      validator + positive example exist; both replay bundles regenerated.
  - [x] Step 3 — `financial_transaction_execution_implemented: false → true` — **flipped 2026-07-25**
        with LP4 increment 2b (PR #184), i.e. only once LP4 could actually send. It moved in lockstep
        with `ORDER_PATH_IMPLEMENTED = True` and the readiness board, asserted to agree
        (`CRYPTO_LIVE_EXECUTION_VERIFICATION_V0.1.md`). `financial_executor_enabled` stays `false`
        and untouched. **Read this as a posture change, not a checkbox:** an order path now exists,
        so READY on the readiness board means a real order can be placed on that machine.
  - [x] New closed schema `live_trading_budget.v0.1` (registered trading caps, self-hashed) —
        done 2026-07-25 (schema + `live_budget.py` + `register_live_trading_budget.py`).
  - [x] Step 6b: the guard reads the registered budget as authoritative (over env caps) — done
        2026-07-25 (`resolve_live_order_limits` + `budget_registered` guard check + the readiness
        `registered_budget` row). No live order without a valid registered budget. Grants nothing.
  - [x] New narrow role `execution.live_trader` — P5, `external_action_allowed: true`, **candidate
        (non-routable)** — done 2026-07-25 (contract + index-only registry entry + hash; passes
        contract-consistency + release gate). Grants nothing; **activating** it (candidate →
        routable) is the separate remaining `ROLE_GOVERNANCE` approval.
  - [x] Validator assertions + the v0.4 positive example + **both replay bundles regenerated** —
        done with steps 8/9 (PR #142). Any future policy edit changes its SHA-256 and owes the
        bundles another rebuild (CRLF-normalized; `rebuild_bundle` has no CLI entrypoint).
- [~] **LP4** order adapter — **increment 1 (skeleton) done 2026-07-25**
      (`runtime/mvp_runtime/crypto/live_execution.py`: adapter protocol, DryRun default, gated
      stub, `submit_and_reconcile` + reconcile vocabulary; design record
      `LP4_ORDER_ADAPTER_DESIGN_V0.1.md`). **Increment 2a (the real signed transport +
      conditional order types) done 2026-07-25** — venue semantics verified against the official
      New Order / Query Order / error-code references (corrected: closePosition excludes both
      quantity and reduceOnly; -2013 = NOT_FOUND vs any other rejection = UNRECONCILABLE; no
      documented auto-cancel, so LP5 must cancel the surviving bracket leg).
      **Increment 2b done 2026-07-25** — `scripts/place_canary_order.py` (the deliberate
      single-canary path, entry-only, exposure read from the venue so the guard's one fail-open
      default is not used); a `canary=True` guard mode exempt from the promotion gate only (the
      chicken-and-egg: a canary earns that evidence) with its **own** confirmation phrase
      (`MVP_LIVE_CANARY_CONFIRMATION`), so neither phrase can authorize the other's capability;
      and the **lockstep governance flip** (`financial_transaction_execution_implemented: true`
      + `ORDER_PATH_IMPLEMENTED = True`, asserted to agree) with both replay bundles regenerated.
      `financial_executor_enabled` and every `runtime_effect`/`cutover` flag stay false.
      **LP4 is complete.** Nothing autonomous routes to the venue — that needs LP5.
- [~] **LP5** position kernel + cycle routing — design records `LP5_POSITION_KERNEL_DESIGN_V0.1.md`
      and `LP5_3_LIVE_LEG_DESIGN_V0.1.md`. **Everything except cycle routing has landed.** LP5.1, 5.2
      and 5.4 are complete, and 5.3 was split at the one line that matters — *decide* vs *send* —
      with **both halves now merged** (#193, #196). What remains is giving the executing leg a
      caller, which is the piece that changes the safety posture.
  - [x] **LP5.1 — position state + reconciliation** (PR #183, 2026-07-25):
        `crypto/live_position.py`. Live positions live in their own `live_positions/` namespace with
        `stage: "live"` (paper keys on `(venue, symbol, timeframe)` with the same `binance_futures`
        venue string, so a shared book would let the paper cycle settle a *real* position). The venue,
        not the store, is the truth: `reconcile_positions` returns RECONCILED / DRIFT /
        ACCOUNT_UNREADABLE, and on anything but RECONCILED entries are refused while **closes stay
        allowed** — being unable to see the account must never trap an open position. Concurrency
        caps: 2 open live positions, 1 per symbol.
  - [x] **LP5.1c — the one fail-open closed** (same PR): `evaluate_live_order_guard`'s
        `current_open_notional_usdt=0.0` default asserted "the account is flat" on no evidence. The
        argument is now **required**, and unknown exposure is reported *at the cap*
        (`compute_open_notional_usdt(None, at_cap=…)`), so not knowing blocks instead of permitting.
  - [x] **LP5.2 — sizing** (PR #186): `crypto/live_sizing.py`. `min(risk-based, budget cap)`, floored
        to the venue's lot step in integer space, then **re-checked** after flooring; a size that
        cannot satisfy both bounds is refused, never defaulted. Risk per trade is 1% of usable
        (available-balance) equity.
  - [x] **LP5.4 — the outcome bridge** (PR #187): a live outcome now carries `result_R`,
        `risk_usdt`, `created_at_utc` and strategy lineage (`candidate_id` /
        `strategy_rule_hash` / `strategy_generation_id`), so `guards.run_risk_guard`, `lifecycle`
        and the C6 feedback report read live results with **no live-specific branch** — a live loss
        streak can finally demote a strategy the way a paper one does. The load-bearing part is the
        **exclusion rule**: `guards._closed_rows` reads a missing `result_R` as `0.0`, i.e. a
        *breakeven*, so an R-less live loss would have **shortened** a loss streak. Rows whose risk
        was never recorded are excluded as `LIVE_OUTCOME_NO_RECORDED_RISK` rather than given a
        fabricated R, and stay fully visible to the daily-loss breaker (which needs no R).
        `live_analysis_summary` reports readable and excluded counts separately so live trades never
        silently re-define a previously reported paper expectancy.
  - [~] **LP5.3 — the live leg.** Split at the one line that matters: **decide** vs **send**.
    - [x] **The entry decision** (PR #193, Thomas 2026-07-25) — `live_filters.py` reads the venue's
          real lot step / minimums / price tick from `exchangeInfo` (on the existing
          `binance_futures` grant; the mock collector deliberately cannot answer, so a mock run
          refuses rather than sizing on invented numbers, and a MARKET order is bound by the
          stricter of `LOT_SIZE`/`MARKET_LOT_SIZE`). `live_entry.plan_live_entry` then assembles
          every door — C4 verdict, LP5.1 reconciliation, concurrency caps, filters, the tick-rounded
          protective bracket, LP5.2 sizing, LP3's final guard — into one auditable decision, with
          `ready` *derived* from the guard's own `approved` rather than asserted. **It contains no
          adapter and imports none**, so it cannot send; it also has no production caller yet, by
          design. The bracket is priced *before* the size so the quantity matches the stop that
          would actually be placed, and both legs round toward the entry so rounding can only shrink
          realised risk, never widen it (a stop that rounds onto the entry refuses, never repairs).
    - [x] **The executing leg** (Thomas 2026-07-25) — `live_leg.py`: `execute_live_entry` opens a
          position only on a RECONCILED fill, places both protective legs as `closePosition`
          conditionals, and **closes any exposure the venue reports if the bracket will not
          place**; `execute_live_exit` closes reduceOnly, cancels the surviving leg (the venue
          auto-cancels nothing), computes realized P&L from actual fills, and records the outcome
          **before** clearing the book. The adapter is **injected**, so the module cannot reach a
          venue on its own and every branch is tested with zero network. Also extended the risk
          guard to see live outcomes — they live in their own store, so the paper provenance split
          never saw them and the breaker would have ignored every live loss.
    - [ ] **The cycle routing** ⚠️ **the last piece, and its own explicit decision.** Design
          record: `docs/runtime-contracts/LP5_3_LIVE_LEG_DESIGN_V0.1.md`. This is the line that
          gives the executing leg an autonomous caller; today the only door is the deliberate
          `scripts/place_canary_order.py`, one canary at a time, and
          `test_no_autonomous_entry_point_reaches_the_live_order_path` (which now also covers
          `live_leg`) fails loudly if an autonomous entry point imports it — **doing this is the
          decision to relax that tripwire.** It also owes the readiness board the *real* open
          exposure, so the honest block-at-cap can lift. The preconditions the design record
          states — this runtime's own paper record (6 closed trades at −0.39R,
          `INSUFFICIENT_SAMPLE`), ≥ 3 clean canaries (0), and the operator grants — bind **this**
          step, not the leg above: a leg with no caller places no orders.
- [ ] **≥ 3 clean canary orders** before any autonomous run (currently **0**; 1 existed in the frozen
      source system and did not migrate). **Unblocked 2026-07-26 (#201):** `resolve_live_order_limits` had
      dropped `canary_confirmation`, so the canary guard compared an empty phrase and refused every
      attempt — the one live door there is did not work. It failed *closed*, so nothing unsafe
      happened, and it is fixed; this is now genuinely actionable. **Operator-only, real money** — `scripts/place_canary_order.py`
      on Thomas's machine with his own keys and its own confirmation phrase
      (`MVP_LIVE_CANARY_CONFIRMATION`, deliberately distinct from the live-trading phrase so neither
      authorizes the other's capability). Claude does not run it.
- [x] The **symbol-starved router** finding — closed 2026-07-25 (PR #148). A crypto schedule with an
      empty request now fans out over every `(symbol, timeframe)` the pool routes on **plus** every
      context holding an open paper position (`cycle.run_pool_cycle`), and `route_entries` matches
      the whole `symbol_scope` rather than `symbol_scope[0]`, booking under the traded symbol. A
      named `SYMBOL [TIMEFRAME]` request is still a single-context operator override.
- [x] ⚠️ **Decided 2026-07-25 (Thomas): option (a)** — the C4 risk guard reads **this runtime's own
      outcomes only**; `run_lifecycle` keeps the full history. Found while correcting Gate 0:
      `import_crypto_history.py` deliberately routes the predecessor's closed outcomes into the
      store *"the C4 risk guard and C6 feedback read"*, and the measured effect was 112 imported
      rows worth **+266.8R** inside the rolling week — so the weekly-loss breaker could not trip
      however this runtime performed. Transient (those rows age out within days) but the cause was
      not, so the cause was fixed: `cycle.run_crypto_cycle` now passes
      `split_by_provenance(outcomes)[0]` to the guard. Lifecycle was left alone deliberately —
      imported outcomes carry strategy lineage, and promotion/demotion is a performance judgement,
      not a safety brake; a test pins the two call sites as scoped differently. The import script
      itself is untouched.

### Review findings — raised and closed 2026-07-26

A full review of the live stack raised six items. Recording them here because each is a rule with a
near-miss behind it, and the reasoning is more reusable than the fixes:

- [x] **The money path had no governance record** (#200). `p5_policy_gate` lists
      `post_action_report_and_audit` among its requirements, and it was the one with no
      implementation: `build_live_order_permission_decision` had **zero** production callers and
      `audit.py` had no financial builder. A repository that audits a memory promotion and a file
      write was about to move real money leaving only one registry row behind.
- [x] **A fail-open came back** (#200). `plan_live_entry(verdict=None)` skipped the C4 guards
      entirely when omitted — the same class as the `current_open_notional_usdt = 0.0` default
      LP5.1c closed, and worse in one way: the **test helper omitted it too**, so the unguarded path
      was the tested happy path. Now required, with a structural test on the signature.
- [x] **The readiness board drifted in the way it exists to prevent** (#200). Its computed rows were
      right; its **prose** described a shipped module as missing. Status moved into a computed row
      pinned to the real import graph, plus a test asserting the prose makes no build claim.
- [x] **Paper R and live R are different statistics sharing one pool** (#200). Paper R is measured on
      intended fills and is cost-free by design; live R on actual fills. Both records now carry
      `r_basis`. Not corrected — live R is the more pessimistic, so the distortion runs conservative.
- [x] **Four places claimed status** (#205). `CLAUDE.md`'s 32 KB Status section became
      `docs/BUILD_HISTORY.md` verbatim; the rules file now points instead of asserting.
- [x] **Nothing forced the executing leg to consume the decision record** — already true when raised:
      `execute_live_entry` takes the decision as its first argument and refuses unless `ready` *and*
      the guard approved.
- [x] **The canary phrase never reached the guard** (#201) — see the in-flight note above. The one
      live door there is had been refusing every attempt.
- [x] **A second source of caps was still reachable** (#203). Both guards defaulted `limits` to
      `LiveOrderLimits.from_env()`, so forgetting an argument fell back to env caps in a design whose
      whole point is that the registered budget is the only source. Now required — the same fix
      LP5.1c applied to `current_open_notional_usdt`, for the same reason.
- [x] **Stage tests covered every stage and no seam** (#203). Each stage of the live path built its
      own input, so a field one stage emits and the next reads could be renamed or dropped with the
      suite still green — which is exactly how #201's bug survived. There is now one end-to-end test
      walking a single trade through route → decide → submit → book → settle → the R consumers.
- [x] **Design records asserted a safety claim that had become false** (#203). Two of them still
      opened with "no code exists yet" and `ORDER_PATH_IMPLEMENTED = False` after LP4 shipped. A gate
      now refuses a record whose *header* disagrees with the policy or the code — header-scoped, so a
      record's body may still narrate history.

Two lessons worth carrying, both about **seams rather than units**: #201's bug survived because both
sides of a join were tested and the join was not, and the P5 gap survived because a policy
requirement had no test asserting any code satisfied it.

## Per-machine setup that does NOT travel via git

A fresh machine has the code but not the local runtime state (gitignored, per CLAUDE.md). To actually
*run* the agent there, re-do the local activation once:

- Core activation pointer: `.runtime_governance_state/CURRENT_CORE_RELEASE.yaml`
- Safety-flag grants: `.runtime_governance_state/safety_flag_activations/*.json`
- Control state + ledger + schedules under `.runtime_governance_state/`

None of this is "planned work" — it is per-machine state you re-establish with the CLAUDE.md
"Core activation" steps + `scripts/activate_safety_flag.py`.

## How to use this file from another computer

```
git pull
```

Then open this file, or just ask Claude Code "남은 작업이 뭐야?" — it will read
`docs/REMAINING_WORK.md` and list the unchecked items above.
